### **âœ… Correct Understanding of `Movement_Class`**
The **Leavitt Convolution makes a 1-bar ahead projection**, and then we check **what actually happened to the Close price**.  

#### **Step 1: `Delta_Close_LC` Definition**
\[
\text{Delta_Close_LC} = \text{Close}(t+1) - \text{Leavitt_Convolution}(t)
\]
This tells us **how much the actual Close price deviated from the Leavitt Convolution's projection**.

#### **Step 2: Converting This Into `Movement_Class`**
\[
\text{Movement_Class} =
\begin{cases} 
1, & \text{if } \text{Delta_Close_LC} > 0.002  \quad \text{(UP)} \\
0, & \text{if } -0.002 \leq \text{Delta_Close_LC} \leq 0.002  \quad \text{(FLAT)} \\
-1, & \text{if } \text{Delta_Close_LC} < -0.002  \quad \text{(DOWN)}
\end{cases}
\]

ðŸ‘‰ **Now, let's correctly interpret what each case means.**

---

### **ðŸ“Š What `Movement_Class` Means**
| `Movement_Class` | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------|
| **1 (UP)** | The Leavitt Convolution projected price **would go up**, and the actual Close price **did move up significantly**. |
| **0 (FLAT)** | The Leavitt Convolution projected price **would stay flat**, and the actual Close price **moved within a small range**. |
| **-1 (DOWN)** | The Leavitt Convolution projected price **would go down**, and the actual Close price **did move down significantly**. |

---

### **ðŸ’¡ The Key Takeaway**
âœ” **`Movement_Class = -1` does NOT mean Leavitt Convolution was wrong.**  
âœ” It means **Leavitt Convolution predicted a downward move, and price actually moved down.**  
âœ” **We are training a model to predict this movement (UP, DOWN, FLAT) ahead of time.**

### **ðŸš€ What This Means for Trading**
- The **classifier is learning whether the market will move UP, DOWN, or FLAT** based on the indicators we provide.
- If the model **predicts DOWN (`-1`) with high confidence**, we can **take short positions**.
- If the model **predicts UP (`1`) with high confidence**, we can **take long positions**.
