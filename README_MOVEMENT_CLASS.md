# **Movement Class Documentation**

## **Understanding `Movement_Class`**
The `Movement_Class` represents a **categorical classification** of market behavior based on **volatility-adjusted price changes**. This classification serves as the **target variable** for our machine learning models, allowing them to predict whether the market will experience a **strong upward move, a neutral movement, or a strong downward move**.

### **Key Clarification:**
Unlike traditional price forecasting, where models attempt to predict **exact future price values**, our approach classifies the **type of movement** the market is likely to experience. This makes predictions **more robust to noise, adaptable to volatility, and directly actionable for trading strategies**.

---

## **How `Movement_Class` is Determined**
The classification process follows these steps:

### **1. Compute Price Change**
$\text{Price Change} = \text{Close}(t) - \text{Close}(t-1)$
This measures the **raw difference** between the current closing price and the previous closing price.

### **2. Calculate a Dynamic Volatility Threshold**
Rather than using a fixed threshold, the model adapts to market conditions by defining a **volatility-adjusted range**:

$$ \text{Dynamic Volatility Threshold} = ATR(t) \times \text{Dynamic Multiplier} $$  

The **Dynamic Multiplier** is calculated as:

$$ \text{Dynamic Multiplier} = \text{Scale Factor} + \left(\frac{\text{Rolling STD of ATR}}{\text{Mean ATR}}\right) \times 0.5 $$  

- This ensures **classification adjusts based on market volatility**, preventing frequent misclassifications in different trading environments.
- **ATR (Average True Range)** is a widely used measure of volatility in financial markets.

### **3. Assign `Movement_Class` Based on Price Change vs. Threshold**
Using the computed threshold, we classify price movement into three categories:

| `Movement_Class` | Condition | Meaning |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **2** | `Price Change > Dynamic Volatility Threshold` | **Strong Up Move** |
| **0** | `Price Change < -Dynamic Volatility Threshold` | **Strong Down Move** |
| **1** | *Otherwise* | **Neutral Movement** |

## **Clarification: `Movement_Class` is a Target Variable**
Since `Movement_Class` is the **target** for our machine learning models, the modelâ€™s goal is to **predict this class for the next time step**. However, **this is not the same as predicting exact price values**.

### **Why Predict Market Behavior Instead of Exact Prices?**
1. **More Robust to Market Noise**  
   - Predicting exact price values is **highly uncertain due to random fluctuations**.  
   - Classification focuses on **meaningful movements**, ignoring small, insignificant fluctuations.  

2. **Directly Actionable for Trading**  
   - If the model predicts **`2 (Strong Up Move)`**, we can **take long positions** with confidence.  
   - If the model predicts **`0 (Strong Down Move)`**, we can **take short positions**.  
   - **No need to convert raw price forecasts into trading signals**â€”classification already aligns with strategy execution.

3. **Volatility-Adjusted Predictions**  
   - A **small price change in a low-volatility market vs. a high-volatility market** is treated differently.  
   - The model learns **when a move is truly significant** rather than reacting to normal price noise.

4. **Improved Model Performance**  
   - Classification tasks **train better** than direct price regression in financial time series.  
   - Models like **Gradient Boosting, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks** perform well with categorical targets.

## **Summary of `Movement_Class` Categories**
| `Movement_Class` | Meaning | Trading Implication |
|-----------------|---------|---------------------|
| **2 (Strong Up Move)** | Price moved **up significantly** beyond the volatility threshold. | **Consider long trades** or trend continuation strategies. |
| **1 (Neutral Move)** | Price movement was **within normal volatility range**. | **No strong directional bias**, possibly sideways market. |
| **0 (Strong Down Move)** | Price moved **down significantly** beyond the volatility threshold. | **Consider short trades** or risk management actions. |

## **Key Takeaways**
âœ” **`Movement_Class` is a target for prediction, but it does not forecast exact price values.**  
âœ” Instead, it classifies market behavior into **Up, Neutral, and Down** movements based on volatility.  
âœ” **Machine learning models use `Movement_Class` to anticipate future market behavior**, making it a powerful tool for trading strategy development.  
âœ” This classification approach **adapts to volatility**, making predictions more stable and actionable.
